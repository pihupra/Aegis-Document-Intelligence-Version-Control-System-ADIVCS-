This setup gives you a **full-stack project** ready for GitHub, showing **C++ expertise, GUI skills, web dev, and database integration** — perfect for resume and interviews.

If you want, I can **write a step-by-step GitHub upload guide with folder structure**, so you can push everything professionally.  

Do you want me to do that next?
